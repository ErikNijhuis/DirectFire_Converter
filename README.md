# OpenFireVert (Open Firewall Converter)

OpenFireVert is an open source firewall configuration conversion tool written in Python.
Support for any firewall type will be added based on requests, demand and developer availability.

This tool generates configuration for supported elements only, that are typically input through CLI or "merged" with a full or running configuration. It does not generate full configuration files.

See the documentation for supported firewall types and details on what configuration elements are converted.

If you encounter any problems when using this tool, please search open issues on GitHub and create a new issue if one does not exist.
